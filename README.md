# Emergency App üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: M&M


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Milan Saji - College Of Engineering, Kallooppaa

### Project Description
The **Emergency App** is a Flutter project that lets users select an emergency type, auto-dial the contact, and then play a calming Veena tune to keep them relaxed.
It‚Äôs a completely unnecessary yet entertaining showcase of Flutter‚Äôs UI and device feature integration.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In the chaos of an emergency, what people truly lack isn‚Äôt medical help or fire trucks‚Äîit‚Äôs a front-row seat to a calming Veena concert. No one‚Äôs ever complained about this, but we decided the world couldn‚Äôt go on without it.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An app that takes your urgent cry for help, dials the emergency number‚Ä¶ and then treats you to a soothing Veena solo. It won‚Äôt put out fires or stop heart attacks, but hey‚Äîyou‚Äôll be panicking in style.
